# Laboratory: Open Source Hardware Development
A collection of tools, software, and, active projects associated with the
Multiverse OS project; and the open source hardaware peripherals and computer
that is intended to run Multiverse OS (although, Multiverse OS will support a
wide variety of machines beyond our security focused (we mean it, not just
marketing like so many other projects that claim to have working hardware
swiches and don't bother to check if they actually work), and easy-to-use Linux
machine).
